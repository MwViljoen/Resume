                    My name is Willem, I grew up on a farm in the freestate. I went to a school not far from there in a small town called "Vrede".
                    I am currently 26 Years old and living in Pretoria. I studied Mechatronic Engineering at Tshwane University of Technology for five years
                    and earned a Diploma and Bachelors Degree in this field. My previous title was an Automation Engineer and I worked in this field for three years,
                    but I soon realized my passions for it has changed. After some research I came across Web Development, 
                    therefore I am currently studying to become a Full Stack Web Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience in the programming and design of machinery that automate factories and also the commissioning/testing
                    of these machines. I spent equal amounts of time on software and hardware/physical work, as well as a lot of driving for resource 
                    and product procurment. I prefer software side of things and thus I have decided on becoming a Web Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy programming and also testing/building projects and products. I am addicted to learning new things and I love a challenge.
                    I have other hobbies such as fishing, hiking and if I had my way I would be traveling around the world if there is time for it, 
                    otherwise I spend time with friends and family.
                </p>
